origin: Build artifacts (dist/) showing as untracked in git status during development

notes:
  - Eliminates noise in git status output
  - Prevents accidental binary commits
  - Follows standard Go project conventions
  - Should be done before more artifacts accumulate

## Task: Add .gitignore for build artifacts and local dev files

## Background & Context

The sticky-dvr repository currently has no .gitignore file. During Phase 1 development, the `make build-backend` command creates a dist/ directory containing compiled binaries (sticky-backend and sticky-initdb). Every time a developer runs `git status`, this dist/ directory appears as untracked, cluttering the output and creating noise that makes legitimate untracked files less visible.

Additionally, as development continues, other common artifacts accumulate:
- Go test binaries and coverage reports
- Editor/IDE configuration directories
- Operating system files (macOS .DS_Store, Windows Thumbs.db)
- Environment configuration files (.env, .env.local)

Without a .gitignore file, developers might accidentally commit these artifacts or miss warning signs when other actual code changes need attention. This is a standard hygiene issue for any Git-tracked project.

## Problem Description

Current behavior when running `git status`:
```
?? dist/
```

The dist/ directory is listed as untracked alongside any actual code changes. This creates visual clutter and increases the likelihood of:
1. Accidental binary commits if developers are not careful
2. Noise that obscures real untracked files needing version control decisions
3. Larger repository size if binaries somehow get committed
4. Unnecessary diffs when developers move between machines or clean/rebuild

Expected behavior after fix:
```
git status
# On branch main
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

The dist/ directory should be automatically ignored by Git, allowing developers to focus on actual code changes and meaningful untracked content.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create file: /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/.gitignore
2. Add the following content (complete file):
   ```
   # Build output
   dist/

   # Go test cache and coverage
   *.test
   *.out
   coverage.html

   # Editor/IDE files
   .idea/
   .vscode/
   *.swp
   *.swo

   # OS files
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db

   # Environment files
   .env
   .env.local
   ```
3. Save the file
4. Verify: Run `git status` and confirm dist/ no longer appears in untracked files
5. Optionally verify with: `git check-ignore -v dist/sticky-backend` (should output that path is ignored)

## Technical Requirements

- File to create: /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/.gitignore
- Location: Repository root, same level as Makefile, CLAUDE.md, compose.yaml
- Format: Standard gitignore format (# for comments, one pattern per line, / for directory suffix)
- Patterns required: dist/, *.test, *.out, coverage.html, .idea/, .vscode/, *.swp, *.swo, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, .env, .env.local

## Success Criteria

1. File .gitignore exists at /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/.gitignore
2. File contains all documented patterns
3. Running `git status` no longer shows `?? dist/` as untracked
4. Running `git ls-files | grep dist` returns no results (dist/ is excluded from index)
5. The file is itself tracked by Git (appears as new file in next commit)
6. Running `git check-ignore -v dist/sticky-backend` confirms the path is ignored

## Expected Outcome

After this fix:
- Build artifacts no longer clutter git status output
- Developers cannot accidentally commit binary files from dist/
- Repository hygiene improved for collaborative development
- Standard Go project conventions followed
- Future Phase 2 development (frontend, proxy) will benefit from clean git status

## Reference Information

- File to create: /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/.gitignore
- Standard Go gitignore reference: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Go.gitignore
- Related build command: /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/Makefile (build-backend target)
- Repository root: /home/mmulligan/Development/whisper-darkly-github/sticky-dvr/

## Notes & Warnings

- This is a low-priority housekeeping task but should be done early to establish clean development practices
- Do not exclude legitimate code directories (backend/, frontend/, scripts/ should NOT be ignored)
- Only ignore generated/temporary files and build artifacts
- The .gitignore file itself should be committed to Git (not ignored)
- Use forward slashes (/) for directory patterns to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Comments in gitignore start with # and are for documentation
- Can verify ignoring is working by checking git index: `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard`
