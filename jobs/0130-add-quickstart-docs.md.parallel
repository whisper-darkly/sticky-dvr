title: Create QUICKSTART.md with from-zero-to-running guide
created: 2026-02-22
origin: POC audit identified no user-facing documentation for getting the stack running
priority: medium
complexity: low
notes:
  - Single-page quickstart, not comprehensive docs
  - Must include environment variables section
  - Note that 503 from health is expected when overseer not running
  - Include both make bootstrap shortcut and manual step-by-step
---

Follow exactly and without stopping:

## Task: Create QUICKSTART.md

## Background & Context

New users of the sticky-dvr stack have no guide for getting from a clean checkout to a running
system. The CLAUDE.md describes the architecture but doesn't provide operational steps.

## File to Create: `QUICKSTART.md`

Create `QUICKSTART.md` in the repo root. Read `Makefile`, `compose.yaml`, and `CLAUDE.md`
first to understand what make targets exist and what environment variables are required.

The file should cover:

### Section 1: Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make
- Git (for cloning)

### Section 2: Quick Start (single command)
```
make bootstrap
```
Then open https://localhost and accept the self-signed certificate warning.
Login with `admin` / `admin`.

### Section 3: What to Expect
- The health endpoint (`/api/health`) may return 503 — this is normal when the overseer
  container is not running. The `overseer_connected: false` field in the response body
  distinguishes this from a real error.
- The dashboard shows an "Overseer offline" badge in this case, not an error.
- An empty subscriptions list on first login is expected.

### Section 4: Step-by-Step (manual)
For users who prefer to understand each step:
1. Generate TLS certs: `make dev-certs`
2. Build images: `make image-all`
3. Start stack: `make run-all`
4. Check status: `docker compose ps`

### Section 5: Environment Variables
Document the key env vars (sourced from compose.yaml and CLAUDE.md):
- `DB_DSN` — PostgreSQL DSN (default: compose-internal)
- `JWT_SECRET` — HS256 shared secret (change in production!)
- `OVERSEER_URL` — WebSocket URL for the overseer service
- `CONVERTER_URL` — HTTP URL for the converter service

### Section 6: Useful Commands
- `make logs-all` — Follow all service logs
- `make restart` — Restart all services
- `make down` — Stop all services
- `make dev` — HTTP-only mode (no TLS, port 8080)

### Section 7: Troubleshooting
- Port 443 in use → check for other NGINX instances
- Cert warning → expected for self-signed certs, accept it
- Login fails with 401 → check JWT_SECRET matches between proxy and backend
- Backend won't start → check DB_DSN and that postgres service is healthy

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `QUICKSTART.md` exists in repo root
- [ ] Covers single-command bootstrap
- [ ] Explains 503/overseer-offline as expected
- [ ] Documents all key env vars
- [ ] Step-by-step manual section present
- [ ] Troubleshooting section with common issues
